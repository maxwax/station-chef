# station CHANGELOG

# 0.2.1

* In atom recipe, install the atom rpm, not the virtualbox rpm. A bug due to copy & pasting the virtualbox code and re-using it for Atom.
* Set rwx permissions on relocated bootstrap.sh so its easier to run manually after cloning the repo
* Determine if atom is installed via checking node['packages'] not node['package']

# 0.2.0

* Deploy $HOME/.bash_profile

# 0.1.1

* Misc changes not included in CHANGELOG. Moving too fast, workflow distracted.

# 0.1.0

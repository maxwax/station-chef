# This is a tool for manually de-duplicating files found in a source
# data set with files found in a backup data set.

# Use case: You have a file, my-best-photo-1985 and it may be on a
# 'source' data set like a master hard drive and it may be on a 
# 'backup' data set like an external backup archive, but in another
# directory location.

# You want an easy way to scan each data set to see if and where it appears
# in each.  So you use the find command to create an index of all files
# on each data set then use this script to repeatedly scan and report
# what is found.

# First, use the 'find' command to list all files in the source and
# output it to 'source-<something>' in the current directory.

# Next, ue the 'find' command to list all files in a backup dataset
# and output it to 'backup-<something>' in the current directory.

# Run this script and enter one or two words to scan in the files

# Grep will perform a case insensitive scan for WORD and optionall WORD2
# in the source and report where it is seen

# It will then do the same for the backup inventory file.

  read -p "== Word 1 |" WORD
  read -p "==== Word 2 |" WORD2

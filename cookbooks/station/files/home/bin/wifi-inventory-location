# Hack script used to let me walk a physical location and capture
# WIFI signal information and perform iperf3 testing from WIFI to 
# a physically connected iperf3 server

# The output captured can then be placed in a spreadsheet and/or
# on a map to show geographical areas with strong or weak signal information

# Instructions:
# 1. Setup a wired Linux system running iperf3 --server on the network
# 2. Walk to an initial location in physical site of a WIFI access point
# 3. Run this script and enter location description (ex: 'under WAP #1')
# 4. Let it capture the signal strength and run an iperf client
#    performance test against the wired server
# 5. Move to the next location
# 6. Repeat at number 4
